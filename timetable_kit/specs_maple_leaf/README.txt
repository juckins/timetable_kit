Notes from Christopher Juckins 2024-11-23
=========================================

Had to modify the .csv as it was not finding just plain "63" and "64" train numbers.
But the resultant PDF is missing icons and has some general formatting issues.
Have not checked data with fine-tooth comb but it seems correct at first glance, in
other words, the Franken-GTFS is still being created correctly.
